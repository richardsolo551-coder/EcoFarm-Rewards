# 🌱 EcoFarm Rewards: Tokenized Sustainable Farming Data Platform

Welcome to EcoFarm Rewards, a blockchain-powered platform that incentivizes farmers to share eco-friendly farming data on-chain! By tokenizing contributions, we address the real-world problem of data scarcity in global climate studies, enabling better research on sustainable agriculture while rewarding farmers for their environmental efforts. Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this system ensures transparent, verifiable data sharing and automated rewards distribution.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Contribute farming data (e.g., soil carbon levels, water usage, crop yields) to global climate datasets  
💰 Earn ERC-20-like fungible tokens (ECO tokens) for verified submissions  
📊 Aggregate anonymized data for researchers and organizations  
✅ Data verification through oracles and community validation  
🔒 Secure farmer registration and privacy controls  
🏆 Staking mechanism to boost rewards for long-term participants  
⚖️ Governance for community-driven updates to reward parameters  
🚫 Penalize fraudulent data with slashing  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Farmers**  
- Register your farm and get verified.  
- Submit eco-friendly farming data (e.g., via IoT devices or manual entry) hashed for privacy.  
- Data gets verified automatically or by community validators.  
- Earn ECO tokens based on data quality and impact.  
- Stake tokens to multiply future rewards or participate in governance.  

**For Researchers/Organizations**  
- Access aggregated, anonymized datasets for climate studies.  
- Query on-chain analytics for insights without compromising privacy.  

**For Validators**  
- Stake ECO tokens to become a validator.  
- Review and approve data submissions for rewards.  
- Risk slashing if malicious behavior is detected.  

The platform uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle everything securely and efficiently on the Stacks blockchain.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Handles farmer registration, verification, and profile management. Ensures only authenticated users can submit data.  
2. **EcoToken.clar**: SIP-10 compliant fungible token contract for ECO rewards. Manages minting, burning, and transfers.  
3. **DataSubmission.clar**: Allows farmers to submit hashed farming data with metadata (e.g., timestamps, metrics). Emits events for verification.  
4. **DataVerifier.clar**: Integrates with oracles for initial checks and enables community validation of submissions.  
5. **RewardDistributor.clar**: Calculates and distributes ECO tokens based on verified data quality, using predefined formulas (e.g., points for carbon sequestration).  
6. **StakingPool.clar**: Manages staking of ECO tokens for farmers and validators, with yield boosts and lock-up periods.  
7. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on changes, like reward rates or verification thresholds.  
8. **DataAnalytics.clar**: Provides on-chain queries for aggregated data stats, ensuring privacy through zero-knowledge proofs or hashing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Clone the repo and deploy contracts using Clarinet.  
- Interact via the Stacks wallet: Call `register-farmer` in FarmerRegistry, then submit data!  
- For testing: Use sample data like soil pH levels or water conservation metrics.  

This project empowers small-scale farmers in developing regions by providing economic incentives for sustainable practices, while supplying valuable, tamper-proof data to combat climate change. Let's build a greener future on-chain!
